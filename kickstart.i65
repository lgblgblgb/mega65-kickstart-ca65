; My try to define some stuff can be included from every kickstart related sources.

.SETCPU	"4510"	; Set CPU to "4510 mode"


; Try to make it clear that we want to use zero page addressing. The intended usage:
; LDA ZP(zp_temp_byte)
; I *think* it's may be better than this syntax which is even complained by ca65 as
; a warning:   LDA <zp_temp_byte

.DEFINE ZP(n) .LOBYTE(n)

.MACRO space label,bytes
label: .res bytes
.ENDMACRO
